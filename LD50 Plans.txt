bullet hell game
theme: delay the inevitable
retro pc98 touhou aesthetic?

story:
	witch of inevitability attacks earth, saying she will accelerate natural process such as the earth dying (due to humans?). says she guarantees these things will happen (put text in red)
	
art:
	don't worry about pixel perfect (not worth it)
	witch looks something like Bern or Lambda (use witch sprite from vania game as base?)
	player
		spaceship (doesn't match aesthetic as well, but easier and fits story)
		witch (matches look, )

gameplay:
	endless bullet hell game. boss is at top of screen nearly the whole time, and throws the projectiles:
	projectile paths:
		straight down
		explosion (several move outwards from circle)
		sin wave downwards
	checkpoints after certain lengths
		choose upgrade (movement speed, health, firerate?)
